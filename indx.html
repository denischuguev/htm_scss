        <h1>Philip Emeagwali</h1>
<p ><b>Philip Emeagwali</b> is a Nigerian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank">Computer scientist</a>. He has been living in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank">United States for<br>
many years.[1] He won the 1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bell_Prize" target="_blank">Gordon Bell Prize </a> ($1,000) for price-performance in<br>
high-performance computing applications, in an oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel<br>
mathematical formulation and implementation.[2][3]</p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
<p> Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended<br> 
in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the<br> 
war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.<br>
He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5] </p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a <br>
    correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in <br>
    mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving <br>
    in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, <br>
    and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine <br>
    suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a <br>
    civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.</p>
<br>

<h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
<p>Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. <br>
His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was <br> 
not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a <br>
violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways <br> 
because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state <br>
Court of Appeals.[8]</p>


<h2>Supercomputing</h2>
<p>Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel<br>
computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He<br>
received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400 <br>
Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also the winner of the <br>
Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking <br>
Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 <br>
Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each <br>
microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]<br>
<br>
Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir<br>
modeling.[1]</p>
